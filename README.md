What is this?

I have a tendency to start projects, add the same things, forget to add some, go back and add them later, etc.

This is an attempt to build a shell of a thing that I (and maybe others) can use as a starting point for projects. Not quite a template, but close enough.

This is going to be highly opinionated. If you don't like it, don't use it. If I wind up adding things that too tightly constrain me later on, I'll strip them out.
